Hello Employers

It may be Obvious due to the recency of the creation of this repository alone but I don't really use github for anything on my own. The last I used github was for a school prject in highschool but due to my school email being deleted after graduation, I no longer have access to that one. However, I have created this now one to share some of the code that I have written in recent years, most of which is game related stuff because that's really all I code in my free time. Below I briefly discuss each of the folders in the repository.

**Bygone**

Bygone is the game that I am currently working on alongside a small team of 6 people. It is an isometric, pixel art RPG. I am one of two programmers working on it. In the folder, I put a few of the objects that I myself coded.
