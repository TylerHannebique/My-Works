**Hello Employers!**

It may be Obvious due to the recency of the creation of this repository alone but I don't really use github for anything on my own. The last I used github was for a school prject in highschool but due to my school email being deleted after graduation, I no longer have access to that one. However, I have created this now one to share some of the code that I have written in recent years, most of which is game related stuff because that's really all I code in my free time. Below I briefly discuss each of the folders in the repository.

**Bygone**

Bygone is the game that I am currently working on alongside a small team of 6 people. It is an isometric, pixel art RPG. I am one of two programmers working on it. In the folder, I put a few of the objects that I myself coded. 
Most of the interesting stuff will be in the Create, Step, and Draw files

* oBattle is the object that controls everything to do with the player being engaged in the games turn based battle systems.
* oCameraManager controlls the camera movements in the game
* oCuttingGame is for rhythm based minigame involving cutting carrots. It is my first attempt at creating a rhythm game.
* oDayNightManager controls the the ingame time and draws a fiter over the game depending on the time of day

If you'd be interested in an actual explination or seeing footage I'd be glad to provide.
